# Architecture

Structural description of the Agilex 7 wideband processing benchmark: the block
decomposition, the module inventory, the clock domains and their crossings, and the
interfaces between blocks. This document is the navigational map from
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) requirements to the RTL under `rtl/`. It records what was actually
built, not what was proposed; every entry must correspond to committed RTL. Rationale
for choices lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), numerical formats in
[NUMERICS.md](NUMERICS.md).

> **Status: skeleton (issue #1).** Headings only. Nothing below is invented ahead of
> the RTL that justifies it; each section is filled by the issue named in its pointer.

## 1. System block diagram

TODO — populated by issue #17 (medium pipeline integration) and extended by issue #20
(full-scale elaboration). Data flow per SPEC §3:
ADC sources → polyphase FIR banks → streaming FFTs → time-frequency history →
frequency-bin alignment → beamforming → power/covariance → CFAR → event packet network
→ abstract memory interface.

## 2. Top-level variants

TODO — populated by issues #2 (`benchmark_sim_top`), #3 (`benchmark_fabric_top`), and
#24 (`benchmark_device_top`). See SPEC §4.

## 3. Module inventory

One row per RTL module: path, parameters, owning issue, brief function.

TODO — each implementing issue appends its own modules.

### 3.1 Packages (`rtl/packages/`)

TODO — populated by issue #4 (fixed-point package) and issue #7 (register map types).

### 3.2 Common and stream infrastructure (`rtl/common/`, `rtl/stream/`)

TODO — populated by issue #5.

### 3.3 CDC primitives (`rtl/cdc/`)

TODO — populated by issue #6.

### 3.4 Memory and corner turn (`rtl/memory/`)

TODO — populated by issue #15.

### 3.5 DSP kernels (`rtl/pfb/`, `rtl/fft/`, `rtl/beamformer/`, `rtl/covariance/`, `rtl/cfar/`)

TODO — populated by issues #9–#14.

### 3.6 Packet fabric (`rtl/packet/`)

TODO — populated by issue #18.

### 3.7 Control plane (`rtl/control/`)

TODO — populated by issues #7, #8, and #19.

### 3.8 Tops (`rtl/top/`)

TODO — populated by issues #3, #17, #20, #24.

## 4. Clock domains

Logical domains defined by SPEC §8 (`core_clk`, `history_clk`, `packet_clk`,
`memory_clk`, `cfg_clk`, `telemetry_clk`) with their benchmark constraint targets.

TODO — populated by issue #6 (domain definition and CDC primitives) and issue #3
(SDC constraint capture).

## 5. Clock-domain crossings

CDC inventory: every crossing, its mechanism (async FIFO / synchronizer / handshake),
and the assertion that guards it, per SPEC §8.

TODO — populated by issue #6; regenerated as an inventory report by later issues.

## 6. Interfaces

### 6.1 Streaming protocol

Ready/valid streaming interface per SPEC §5.

TODO — populated by issue #5.

### 6.2 Register/control interface

TODO — populated by issue #7.

### 6.3 Abstract memory interface

TODO — populated by issue #19; HBM2e binding by issue #24.

### 6.4 Event packet format and virtual channels

TODO — populated by issue #18.

## 7. Parameterization and elaboration

How `config/*.json` (tiny / medium / large / full_agmf039) drives a single RTL codebase
per SPEC §11.

TODO — populated by issue #2 (config plumbing into the build) and issue #20.

## 8. Latency and throughput budget

TODO — populated per block by the implementing issues; consolidated by issue #17 and
issue #20.
